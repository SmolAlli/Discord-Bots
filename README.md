# Discord-Bots

This is a bot I made using Python. It might work.

## Installation

-   Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/SmolAlli/Discord-Bots -b python`

-   Change directories to be in it: `cd Discord-Bots`

-   Set up a .env file with the following options:

    -   DISCORD_TOKEN
    -   DISCORD_OVERRIDE_ROLE
    -   DISCORD_VC

-   Start the bot: `python bot.py`

-   Run a command with your bot using the `bd!` prefix.

*   Note: I cannot confirm nor deny that this bot will work. I made it a while ago and I'm just keeping it here to preserve it, I guess.
