# BetterDiscord Bot

A bot I created for the gaming server for BetterDiscord (it may or may not exist ;) )

## Installation

-   Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/SmolAlli/Discord-Bots`

-   Change directories to be in it: `cd Discord-Bots`

-   Set up a .env file with the following options:

    -   token (bot token)
    -   dbToken (token for your mongodb database. if you want to support something else, gl changing the code :^) )
    -   clientid (the bot's id. right click in the member list and click "copy id" with developer mode enabled in settings -> advanced)

-   Install node modules `npm i`

-   Start the bot: `npm run dev`

-   Run a command with your bot using the slash commands.
